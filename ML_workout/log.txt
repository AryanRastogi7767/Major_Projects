Project log:

21/6/2020 -- added test_size input functionality
             changed multi class metrics from "micro" to "macro"
             added source of datasets in description of the data
             added "Show data info" checkbox and functionality that shows data shape and dist of target in train and test data
             added class weights in multi class classification algorithms

22/6/2020 -- added data pre-processing steps for all the datasets.
             added oversampling feature for datasets. Random over sampler and SMOTE
             
29/6/2020 -- downloaded and read about boston housing dataset

30/6/2020 -- added ROC-AUC Curve in show_plots_mul() function using yellowbrick library

1/7/2020 -- parallelized the computation of Logistic Regression, Random Forests and KNN in binary and multi-class classification(n_jobs =-1)

2/7/2020 -- added regression section
	    changed Logistic regression part to Linear Regression
            added view_metrics_reg() function
            changed algorithms from classifier to regressor
            edited the hyperparameters of the algorithms
            added boston housing data in regression

3/7/2020 -- added distplots in show_data_info
            added advertising data
            removed Gaussian NB from regression
            added and completed shoe_plots_reg() function
            
4/5/2020 -- added Class Prediction Error plot instead of Precision-Recall Curve in show_plots_mul() function
            found best scores on mushrooms, titanic and iris dataset

TODO:
* Add more information of the algorithms.
* Try and find the best score on each dataset and mention it for user to achieve.
* Use better plots and viz to show results.
* Try and remove the warnings on the cmd.
